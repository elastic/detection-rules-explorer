Adversaries can leverage an open-source tool PRoot\nto expand the scope of their operations to multiple Linux distributions and simplify their necessary efforts.\nIn a normal threat scenario, the scope of an attack is limited by the varying configurations of each Linux distribution.\nWith PRoot, it provides an attacker with a consistent operational environment across different Linux distributions,\nsuch as Ubuntu, Fedora, and Alpine. PRoot also provides emulation capabilities that allow for malware built on other\narchitectures, such as ARM, to be run.The post-exploitation technique called bring your own filesystem (BYOF),\ncan be used by the threat actors to execute malicious payload or elevate privileges or perform network scans or\norchestrate another attack on the environment. Although PRoot was originally not developed with malicious intent\nit can be easily tuned to work for one.\n","from":"now-9m","index":["logs-endpoint.events.*"],"language":"eql","license":"Elastic License v2","name":"Potential Defense Evasion via PRoot","references":["https://proot-me.github.io/"],"risk_score":47,"rule_id":"5c9ec990-37fa-4d5c-abfc-8d432f3dedd0","severity":"medium","tags":["Domain: Endpoint","OS: Linux","Use Case: Threat Detection","Tactic: Defense Evasion"],"timestamp_override":"event.ingested","type":"eql","query":"process where  event.action == \"exec\" and process.parent.name ==\"proot\" and host.os.type == \"linux\"\n","threat":[{"framework":"MITRE ATT&CK","technique":[{"id":"T1211","name":"Exploitation for Defense Evasion","reference":"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1211/"}],"tactic":{"id":"TA0005","name":"Defense Evasion","reference":"https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0005/"}}]}}},"__N_SSG":true}
