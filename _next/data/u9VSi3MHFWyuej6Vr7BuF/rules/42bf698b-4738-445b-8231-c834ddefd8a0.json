This could be indicative of a brute force or password spraying attack, where an adversary may attempt to gain unauthorized access to user accounts by guessing the passwords.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps:\n\n- Review the `source.ip` field to identify the IP address from which the high volume of failed login attempts originated.\n- Look into the `event.outcome` field to verify that these are indeed failed authentication attempts.\n- Determine the `user.name` or `user.email` related to these failed login attempts. If the attempts are spread across multiple accounts, it might indicate a password spraying attack.\n- Check the timeline of the events. Are the failed attempts spread out evenly, or are there burst periods, which might indicate an automated tool?\n- Determine the geographical location of the source IP. Is this location consistent with the user's typical login location?\n- Analyze any previous successful logins from this IP. Was this IP previously associated with successful logins?\n\n### False positive analysis:\n\n- A single user or automated process that attempts to authenticate using expired or wrong credentials multiple times may trigger a false positive.\n- Analyze the behavior of the source IP. If the IP is associated with legitimate users or services, it may be a false positive.\n\n### Response and remediation:\n\n- If you identify unauthorized access attempts, consider blocking the source IP at the firewall level.\n- Notify the users who are targeted by the attack. Ask them to change their passwords and ensure they use unique, complex passwords.\n- Enhance monitoring on the affected user accounts for any suspicious activity.\n- If the attack is persistent, consider implementing CAPTCHA or account lockouts after a certain number of failed login attempts.\n- If the attack is persistent, consider implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) for the affected user accounts.\n- Review and update your security policies based on the findings from the incident.\n\n## Setup\n\nThe Okta Fleet integration, Filebeat module, or similarly structured data is required to be compatible with this rule.","references":["https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/system-log/","https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/event-types/","https://www.elastic.co/security-labs/testing-okta-visibility-and-detection-dorothy","https://www.elastic.co/security-labs/monitoring-okta-threats-with-elastic-security","https://www.elastic.co/security-labs/starter-guide-to-understanding-okta"],"risk_score":47,"rule_id":"42bf698b-4738-445b-8231-c834ddefd8a0","severity":"medium","tags":["Use Case: Identity and Access Audit","Tactic: Credential Access","Data Source: Okta"],"timestamp_override":"event.ingested","type":"threshold","query":"event.dataset:okta.system and event.category:authentication and event.outcome:failure\n","threat":[{"framework":"MITRE ATT&CK","technique":[{"id":"T1110","name":"Brute Force","reference":"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110/"}],"tactic":{"id":"TA0006","name":"Credential Access","reference":"https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0006/"}}],"threshold":{"field":["source.ip"],"value":25}}}},"__N_SSG":true}
