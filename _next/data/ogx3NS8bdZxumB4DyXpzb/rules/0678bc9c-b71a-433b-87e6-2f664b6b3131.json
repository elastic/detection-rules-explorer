Anomalies are detected using Elastic's Anomaly Detection feature.\n\n#### Prerequisite Requirements:\n- Fleet is required for Lateral Movement Detection.\n- To configure Fleet Server refer to the [documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/fleet-server.html).\n- File events collected by the [Elastic Defend](https://docs.elastic.co/en/integrations/endpoint) integration.\n- To install Elastic Defend, refer to the [documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/current/install-endpoint.html).\n\n#### The following steps should be executed to install assets associated with the Lateral Movement Detection integration:\n- Go to the Kibana homepage. Under Management, click Integrations.\n- In the query bar, search for Lateral Movement Detection and select the integration to see more details about it.\n- Under Settings, click Install Lateral Movement Detection assets and follow the prompts to install the assets.\n\n#### Anomaly Detection Setup\nBefore you can enable rules for Lateral Movement Detection, you'll need to enable the corresponding Anomaly Detection jobs.\n- Go to the Kibana homepage. Under Analytics, click Machine Learning.\n- Under Anomaly Detection, click Jobs, and then click \"Create job\". Select the Data View containing your file events. For example, this would be `logs-endpoint.events.*` if you used Elastic Defend to collect events.\n- If the selected Data View contains events that match the query in [this](https://github.com/elastic/integrations/blob/main/packages/lmd/kibana/ml_module/lmd-ml.json) configuration file, you will see a card for Lateral Movement Detection under \"Use preconfigured jobs\".\n- Keep the default settings and click \"Create jobs\" to start the anomaly detection jobs and datafeeds.\n","references":["https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/current/prebuilt-ml-jobs.html","https://docs.elastic.co/en/integrations/lmd","https://www.elastic.co/blog/detecting-lateral-movement-activity-a-new-kibana-integration","https://www.elastic.co/blog/remote-desktop-protocol-connections-elastic-security"],"risk_score":21,"rule_id":"0678bc9c-b71a-433b-87e6-2f664b6b3131","severity":"low","tags":["Use Case: Lateral Movement Detection","Rule Type: ML","Rule Type: Machine Learning","Tactic: Lateral Movement"],"type":"machine_learning","threat":[{"framework":"MITRE ATT&CK","technique":[{"id":"T1210","name":"Exploitation of Remote Services","reference":"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1210/"}],"tactic":{"id":"TA0008","name":"Lateral Movement","reference":"https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0008/"}}]}}},"__N_SSG":true}
