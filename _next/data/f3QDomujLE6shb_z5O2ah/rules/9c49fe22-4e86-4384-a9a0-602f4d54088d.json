While every effort has been made to ensure its quality, we recommend validating the content and adapting it to suit your specific environment and operational needs.\n\n### Investigating Microsoft 365 Impossible travel activity\n\nMicrosoft 365's security features monitor user sign-ins to detect anomalies like impossible travel, where a user appears to log in from geographically distant locations in a short time. Adversaries may exploit compromised credentials to access accounts from unexpected locations. The detection rule identifies such suspicious logins by analyzing audit logs for successful sign-ins flagged as impossible travel, helping to mitigate unauthorized access.\n\n### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Review the audit logs for the specific event.dataset:o365.audit to gather details about the sign-in attempt, including the timestamp, IP addresses, and user account involved.\n- Cross-reference the event.provider:SecurityComplianceCenter logs to identify any additional security alerts or anomalies associated with the same user account or IP addresses.\n- Analyze the event.category:web logs to determine the geographical locations of the sign-ins and assess the feasibility of the travel between these locations within the given timeframe.\n- Investigate the user account's recent activity to identify any other suspicious behavior or unauthorized access attempts, focusing on event.action:\"Impossible travel activity\".\n- Check the event.outcome:success to confirm that the sign-in was successful and assess the potential impact of the unauthorized access.\n- Contact the user to verify if they were traveling or if they recognize the sign-in activity, and advise them to change their password if the activity is deemed suspicious.\n- Consider implementing additional security measures, such as multi-factor authentication, for the affected user account to prevent future unauthorized access.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- Frequent travel by users can trigger false positives. Implement a policy to whitelist known travel patterns for specific users who often travel between the same locations.\n- Use of VPNs or proxy services can result in logins appearing from different geographic locations. Identify and exclude IP addresses associated with trusted VPN services used by your organization.\n- Remote work scenarios where users log in from multiple locations in a short time can be misinterpreted. Establish a baseline for remote work patterns and adjust the rule to accommodate these behaviors.\n- Shared accounts accessed by multiple users from different locations can cause false positives. Consider implementing stricter access controls or transitioning to individual accounts to reduce this risk.\n- Regularly review and update the list of known safe locations and IP addresses to ensure that legitimate activities are not flagged as suspicious.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Immediately isolate the affected user account by disabling it to prevent further unauthorized access.\n- Initiate a password reset for the compromised account and enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) to enhance security.\n- Review the audit logs for the affected account to identify any unauthorized access or data exfiltration activities and document findings for further analysis.\n- Notify the user and relevant stakeholders about the incident, providing guidance on recognizing phishing attempts and securing their credentials.\n- Escalate the incident to the security operations team for a thorough investigation to determine the root cause and potential impact.\n- Implement geo-blocking policies to restrict access from high-risk locations that are not relevant to the organization's operations.\n- Update and refine security monitoring rules to enhance detection capabilities for similar suspicious activities in the future.\n\n## Important\n\nThis rule is no longer applicable based on changes to Microsoft Defender for Office 365.
