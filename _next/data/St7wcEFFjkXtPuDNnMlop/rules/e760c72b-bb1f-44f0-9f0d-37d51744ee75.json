Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).\n","references":["https://www.genians.co.kr/blog/threat_intelligence/facebook"],"risk_score":73,"rule_id":"e760c72b-bb1f-44f0-9f0d-37d51744ee75","severity":"high","tags":["Domain: Endpoint","OS: Windows","Use Case: Threat Detection","Tactic: Execution","Tactic: Initial Access","Resources: Investigation Guide","Data Source: Elastic Endgame","Data Source: Elastic Defend","Data Source: Sysmon","Data Source: Microsoft Defender for Endpoint","Data Source: SentinelOne","Language: eql"],"timestamp_override":"event.ingested","type":"eql","query":"process where host.os.type == \"windows\" and event.type == \"start\" and\n process.parent.executable : \"?:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\mmc.exe\" and endswith~(process.parent.args, \".msc\") and\n not process.parent.args : (\"?:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\*.msc\", \"?:\\\\Windows\\\\SysWOW64\\\\*.msc\", \"?:\\\\Program files\\\\*.msc\", \"?:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\*.msc\")\n","threat":[{"framework":"MITRE ATT&CK","technique":[{"id":"T1204","name":"User Execution","reference":"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204/","subtechnique":[{"id":"T1204.002","name":"Malicious File","reference":"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204/002/"}]}],"tactic":{"id":"TA0002","name":"Execution","reference":"https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0002/"}},{"framework":"MITRE ATT&CK","technique":[{"id":"T1566","name":"Phishing","reference":"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/","subtechnique":[{"id":"T1566.001","name":"Spearphishing Attachment","reference":"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/001/"},{"id":"T1566.002","name":"Spearphishing Link","reference":"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/002/"}]}],"tactic":{"id":"TA0001","name":"Initial Access","reference":"https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0001/"}}]}}},"__N_SSG":true}
