Upon configuration, the integration allows the Elastic Agent to monitor events on your host and send data to the Elastic Security app.\n\n#### Prerequisite Requirements:\n- Fleet is required for Elastic Defend.\n- To configure Fleet Server refer to the [documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/fleet-server.html).\n\n#### The following steps should be executed in order to add the Elastic Defend integration on a Linux System:\n- Go to the Kibana home page and click \"Add integrations\".\n- In the query bar, search for \"Elastic Defend\" and select the integration to see more details about it.\n- Click \"Add Elastic Defend\".\n- Configure the integration name and optionally add a description.\n- Select the type of environment you want to protect, either \"Traditional Endpoints\" or \"Cloud Workloads\".\n- Select a configuration preset. Each preset comes with different default settings for Elastic Agent, you can further customize these later by configuring the Elastic Defend integration policy. [Helper guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/current/configure-endpoint-integration-policy.html).\n- We suggest selecting \"Complete EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response)\" as a configuration setting, that provides \"All events; all preventions\"\n- Enter a name for the agent policy in \"New agent policy name\". If other agent policies already exist, you can click the \"Existing hosts\" tab and select an existing policy instead.\nFor more details on Elastic Agent configuration settings, refer to the [helper guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/8.10/agent-policy.html).\n- Click \"Save and Continue\".\n- To complete the integration, select \"Add Elastic Agent to your hosts\" and continue to the next section to install the Elastic Agent on your hosts.\nFor more details on Elastic Defend refer to the [helper guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/current/install-endpoint.html).\n","severity":"medium","tags":["Domain: Endpoint","OS: Linux","Use Case: Threat Detection","Tactic: Privilege Escalation","Use Case: Vulnerability","Data Source: Elastic Defend","Language: eql"],"type":"eql","query":"sequence by host.id with maxspan=1m\n  [process where host.os.type == \"linux\" and event.type == \"start\" and event.action == \"exec\" and \n   process.name in (\"gcc\", \"g++\", \"cc\") and user.id != \"0\"] by process.args\n  [file where host.os.type == \"linux\" and event.action == \"creation\" and event.type == \"creation\" and \n   process.name == \"ld\" and user.id != \"0\"] by file.name\n  [process where host.os.type == \"linux\" and event.type == \"start\" and event.action == \"exec\" and \n   user.id != \"0\"] by process.name\n  [process where host.os.type == \"linux\" and event.action in (\"uid_change\", \"guid_change\") and event.type == \"change\" and \n   user.id == \"0\"] by process.name\n","threat":[{"framework":"MITRE ATT&CK","technique":[{"id":"T1068","name":"Exploitation for Privilege Escalation","reference":"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1068/"}],"tactic":{"id":"TA0004","name":"Privilege Escalation","reference":"https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0004/"}}]}}},"__N_SSG":true}
