RDP is commonly used by\nsystem administrators to remotely control a system for maintenance or to use shared resources. It should almost never be\ndirectly exposed to the Internet, as it is frequently targeted and exploited by threat actors as an initial access or\nbackdoor vector.\n","false_positives":["    Some network security policies allow RDP directly from the Internet but usage that is unfamiliar to server or\n    network owners can be unexpected and suspicious. RDP services may be exposed directly to the Internet in some\n    networks such as cloud environments. In such cases, only RDP gateways, bastions or jump servers may be expected\n    expose RDP directly to the Internet and can be exempted from this rule. RDP may be required by some work-flows such\n    as remote access and support for specialized software products and servers. Such work-flows are usually known and\n    not unexpected.\n    "],"from":"now-9m","index":["packetbeat-*","auditbeat-*","filebeat-*","logs-network_traffic.*","logs-panw.panos*"],"language":"kuery","license":"Elastic License v2","name":"RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) from the Internet","references":["https://www.iana.org/assignments/iana-ipv4-special-registry/iana-ipv4-special-registry.xhtml"],"risk_score":47,"rule_id":"8c1bdde8-4204-45c0-9e0c-c85ca3902488","severity":"medium","tags":["Tactic: Command and Control","Domain: Endpoint","Use Case: Threat Detection","Data Source: PAN-OS"],"timeline_id":"300afc76-072d-4261-864d-4149714bf3f1","timeline_title":"Comprehensive Network Timeline","timestamp_override":"event.ingested","type":"query","query":"(event.dataset: network_traffic.flow or (event.category: (network or network_traffic))) and\n  network.transport:tcp and (destination.port:3389 or event.dataset:zeek.rdp) and\n  not source.ip:(\n    10.0.0.0/8 or\n    127.0.0.0/8 or\n    169.254.0.0/16 or\n    172.16.0.0/12 or\n    192.0.0.0/24 or\n    192.0.0.0/29 or\n    192.0.0.8/32 or\n    192.0.0.9/32 or\n    192.0.0.10/32 or\n    192.0.0.170/32 or\n    192.0.0.171/32 or\n    192.0.2.0/24 or\n    192.31.196.0/24 or\n    192.52.193.0/24 or\n    192.168.0.0/16 or\n    192.88.99.0/24 or\n    224.0.0.0/4 or\n    100.64.0.0/10 or\n    192.175.48.0/24 or\n    198.18.0.0/15 or\n    198.51.100.0/24 or\n    203.0.113.0/24 or\n    240.0.0.0/4 or\n    \"::1\" or\n    \"FE80::/10\" or\n    \"FF00::/8\"\n  ) and\n  destination.ip:(\n    10.0.0.0/8 or\n    172.16.0.0/12 or\n    192.168.0.0/16\n  )\n","threat":[{"framework":"MITRE ATT&CK","tactic":{"id":"TA0011","name":"Command and Control","reference":"https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0011/"}},{"framework":"MITRE ATT&CK","technique":[{"id":"T1021","name":"Remote Services","reference":"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/"}],"tactic":{"id":"TA0008","name":"Lateral Movement","reference":"https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0008/"}},{"framework":"MITRE ATT&CK","technique":[{"id":"T1190","name":"Exploit Public-Facing Application","reference":"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1190/"}],"tactic":{"id":"TA0001","name":"Initial Access","reference":"https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0001/"}}]}}},"__N_SSG":true}
