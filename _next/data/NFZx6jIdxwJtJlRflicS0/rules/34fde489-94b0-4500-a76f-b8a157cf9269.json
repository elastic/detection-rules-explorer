Telnet is commonly used by system\nadministrators to remotely control older or embedded systems using the command line shell. It should almost never be\ndirectly exposed to the Internet, as it is frequently targeted and exploited by threat actors as an initial access or\nbackdoor vector. As a plain-text protocol, it may also expose usernames and passwords to anyone capable of observing the\ntraffic.\n","false_positives":["    IoT (Internet of Things) devices and networks may use telnet and can be excluded if desired. Some business\n    work-flows may use Telnet for administration of older devices. These often have a predictable behavior. Telnet\n    activity involving an unusual source or destination may be more suspicious. Telnet activity involving a production\n    server that has no known associated Telnet work-flow or business requirement is often suspicious.\n    "],"from":"now-9m","index":["packetbeat-*","auditbeat-*","filebeat-*","logs-network_traffic.*"],"language":"kuery","license":"Elastic License v2","name":"Accepted Default Telnet Port Connection","risk_score":47,"rule_id":"34fde489-94b0-4500-a76f-b8a157cf9269","severity":"medium","tags":["Domain: Endpoint","Use Case: Threat Detection","Tactic: Command and Control","Tactic: Lateral Movement","Tactic: Initial Access"],"timeline_id":"300afc76-072d-4261-864d-4149714bf3f1","timeline_title":"Comprehensive Network Timeline","timestamp_override":"event.ingested","type":"query","query":"(event.dataset:network_traffic.flow or event.category:(network or network_traffic))\n    and event.type:connection and not event.action:(\n        flow_dropped or denied or deny or\n        flow_terminated or timeout or Reject or network_flow)\n    and destination.port:23\n","threat":[{"framework":"MITRE ATT&CK","tactic":{"id":"TA0011","name":"Command and Control","reference":"https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0011/"}},{"framework":"MITRE ATT&CK","technique":[{"id":"T1021","name":"Remote Services","reference":"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/"}],"tactic":{"id":"TA0008","name":"Lateral Movement","reference":"https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0008/"}},{"framework":"MITRE ATT&CK","technique":[{"id":"T1190","name":"Exploit Public-Facing Application","reference":"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1190/"}],"tactic":{"id":"TA0001","name":"Initial Access","reference":"https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0001/"}}]}}},"__N_SSG":true}
