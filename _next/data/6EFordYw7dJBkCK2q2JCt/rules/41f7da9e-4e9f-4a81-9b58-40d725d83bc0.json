The mount command is used to make a\ndevice or file system accessible to the system, and then to connect its root directory to a specified mount point on the\nlocal file system. When launched inside a privileged container--a container deployed with all the capabilities of the\nhost machine-- an attacker can access sensitive host level files which could be used for further privilege escalation\nand container escapes to the host machine. Any usage of mount inside a running privileged container should be further\ninvestigated.\n","from":"now-6m","index":["logs-cloud_defend*"],"interval":"5m","language":"eql","license":"Elastic License v2","name":"Mount Launched Inside a Privileged Container","references":["https://book.hacktricks.xyz/linux-hardening/privilege-escalation/docker-security/docker-breakout-privilege-escalation#privileged"],"risk_score":21,"rule_id":"41f7da9e-4e9f-4a81-9b58-40d725d83bc0","severity":"low","tags":["Data Source: Elastic Defend for Containers","Domain: Container","OS: Linux","Use Case: Threat Detection","Tactic: Privilege Escalation"],"timestamp_override":"event.ingested","type":"eql","query":"process where event.module == \"cloud_defend\" and  event.type== \"start\" and \n(process.name== \"mount\" or process.args== \"mount\") and container.security_context.privileged == true\n","threat":[{"framework":"MITRE ATT&CK","technique":[{"id":"T1611","name":"Escape to Host","reference":"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1611/"}],"tactic":{"id":"TA0004","name":"Privilege Escalation","reference":"https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0004/"}}]}}},"__N_SSG":true}
