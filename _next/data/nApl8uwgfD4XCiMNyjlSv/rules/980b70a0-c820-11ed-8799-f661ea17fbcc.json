Consider changing this interval to a lower value, such as 10 minutes (10m).\n- See the following references for further information:\n  - https://support.google.com/a/answer/7061566\n  - https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-module-google_workspace.html","references":["https://support.google.com/drive/answer/2494822"],"risk_score":73,"rule_id":"980b70a0-c820-11ed-8799-f661ea17fbcc","severity":"high","tags":["Domain: Cloud","Data Source: Google Workspace","Use Case: Configuration Audit","Tactic: Credential Access"],"timestamp_override":"event.ingested","type":"eql","query":"file where event.dataset == \"google_workspace.drive\" and event.action : (\"copy\", \"view\", \"download\") and\n    google_workspace.drive.visibility: \"people_with_link\" and source.user.email == \"\" and\n    file.extension: (\n        \"token\",\"assig\", \"pssc\", \"keystore\", \"pub\", \"pgp.asc\", \"ps1xml\", \"pem\", \"gpg.sig\", \"der\", \"key\",\n        \"p7r\", \"p12\", \"asc\", \"jks\", \"p7b\", \"signature\", \"gpg\", \"pgp.sig\", \"sst\", \"pgp\", \"gpgz\", \"pfx\", \"crt\",\n        \"p8\", \"sig\", \"pkcs7\", \"jceks\", \"pkcs8\", \"psc1\", \"p7c\", \"csr\", \"cer\", \"spc\", \"ps2xml\")\n","threat":[{"framework":"MITRE ATT&CK","technique":[{"id":"T1552","name":"Unsecured Credentials","reference":"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/","subtechnique":[{"id":"T1552.004","name":"Private Keys","reference":"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/004/"}]}],"tactic":{"id":"TA0006","name":"Credential Access","reference":"https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0006/"}}]}}},"__N_SSG":true}
