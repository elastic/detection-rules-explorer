With `auditd_manager`, administrators can easily define audit rules, track system events, and generate comprehensive audit reports, improving overall security and compliance in the system.\n\n#### The following steps should be executed in order to add the Elastic Agent System integration \"auditd_manager\" on a Linux System:\n- Go to the Kibana home page and click “Add integrations”.\n- In the query bar, search for “Auditd Manager” and select the integration to see more details about it.\n- Click “Add Auditd Manager”.\n- Configure the integration name and optionally add a description.\n- Review optional and advanced settings accordingly.\n- Add the newly installed “auditd manager” to an existing or a new agent policy, and deploy the agent on a Linux system from which auditd log files are desirable.\n- Click “Save and Continue”.\n- For more details on the integration refer to the [helper guide](https://docs.elastic.co/integrations/auditd_manager).\n\n#### Rule Specific Setup Note\nAuditd Manager subscribes to the kernel and receives events as they occur without any additional configuration.\nHowever, if more advanced configuration is required to detect specific behavior, audit rules can be added to the integration in either the \"audit rules\" configuration box or the \"auditd rule files\" box by specifying a file to read the audit rules from.\n- For this detection rule the following additional audit rules are required to be added to the integration:\n  -- \"-w /etc/ -p rwxa -k audit_recursive_etc\"\n  -- \"-w /root/ -p rwxa -k audit_root\"\n","severity":"medium","tags":["Data Source: Auditd Manager","Domain: Endpoint","OS: Linux","Use Case: Threat Detection","Tactic: Privilege Escalation","Data Source: Elastic Defend"],"type":"eql","query":"sequence by host.id, process.pid with maxspan=1s\n  [process where host.os.type == \"linux\" and event.type == \"start\" and event.action == \"exec\" and\n   process.name != null and process.thread.capabilities.effective : (\"CAP_CHOWN\", \"CAP_FOWNER\") and\n   process.command_line : (\"*sudoers*\", \"*passwd*\", \"*shadow*\", \"*/root/*\") and user.id != \"0\"]\n  [file where host.os.type == \"linux\" and event.action == \"changed-file-ownership-of\" and event.type == \"change\" and\n   event.outcome == \"success\" and file.path in (\n     \"/etc/passwd\",\n     \"/etc/shadow\",\n     \"/etc/sudoers\",\n     \"/root/.ssh/*\"\n   ) and user.id != \"0\"\n  ]\n","threat":[{"framework":"MITRE ATT&CK","technique":[{"id":"T1068","name":"Exploitation for Privilege Escalation","reference":"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1068/"}],"tactic":{"id":"TA0004","name":"Privilege Escalation","reference":"https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0004/"}}]}}},"__N_SSG":true}
