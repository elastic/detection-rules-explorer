This can be due to initial access,\npersistence, command-and-control, or exfiltration activity. For example, when a user clicks on a link in a phishing\nemail or opens a malicious document, a request may be sent to download and run a payload from a server in a country\nwhich does not normally appear in network traffic or business work-flows. Malware instances and persistence mechanisms\nmay communicate with command-and-control (C2) infrastructure in their country of origin, which may be an unusual\ndestination country for the source network.\n","false_positives":["    Business workflows that occur very occasionally, and involve a business relationship with an organization in a\n    country that does not routinely appear in network events, can trigger this alert. A new business workflow with an\n    organization in a country with which no workflows previously existed may trigger this alert - although the model\n    will learn that the new destination country is no longer anomalous as the activity becomes ongoing.
