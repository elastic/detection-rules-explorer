This is to ensure that it captures as many alerts as possible.\n\n**IMPORTANT:** The rule's **Max alerts per run** setting can be superseded by the `xpack.alerting.rules.run.alerts.max` Kibana config setting, which determines the maximum alerts generated by _any_ rule in the Kibana alerting framework. For example, if `xpack.alerting.rules.run.alerts.max` is set to 1000, this rule will still generate no more than 1000 alerts even if its own **Max alerts per run** is set higher.\n\nTo make sure this rule can generate as many alerts as it's configured in its own **Max alerts per run** setting, increase the `xpack.alerting.rules.run.alerts.max` system setting accordingly.\n\n**NOTE:** Changing `xpack.alerting.rules.run.alerts.max` is not possible in Serverless projects.","severity":"high","tags":["Data Source: Elastic Endgame"],"timestamp_override":"event.ingested","type":"query","query":"event.kind:alert and event.module:endgame and endgame.metadata.type:prevention and (event.action:file_classification_event or endgame.event_subtype_full:file_classification_event)\n"}}},"__N_SSG":true}
