In many organizations, new\nusernames are not often created apart from specific types of system activities, such as creating new accounts for new\nemployees. These user accounts quickly become active and routine. Events from rarely used usernames can point to\nsuspicious activity. Additionally, automated Linux fleets tend to see activity from rarely used usernames only when\npersonnel log in to make authorized or unauthorized changes, or threat actors have acquired credentials and log in for\nmalicious purposes.

Here are some possible avenues of investigation:\n- Consider the user as identified by the username field. Is this program part of an expected workflow for the user who ran this program on this host? Could this be related to troubleshooting or debugging activity by a developer or site reliability engineer?\n- Examine the history of user activity. If this user only manifested recently, it might be a service account for a new software package. If it has a consistent cadence (for example if it runs monthly or quarterly), it might be part of a monthly or quarterly business process.\n- Examine the process arguments, title and working directory. These may provide indications as to the source of the program or the nature of the tasks that the user is performing.","references":["https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/current/prebuilt-ml-jobs.html"],"risk_score":21,"rule_id":"b347b919-665f-4aac-b9e8-68369bf2340c","severity":"low","tags":["Domain: Endpoint","OS: Linux","Use Case: Threat Detection","Rule Type: ML","Rule Type: Machine Learning","Tactic: Initial Access"],"type":"machine_learning","threat":[{"framework":"MITRE ATT&CK","technique":[{"id":"T1078","name":"Valid Accounts","reference":"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/"}],"tactic":{"id":"TA0001","name":"Initial Access","reference":"https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0001/"}}]}}},"__N_SSG":true}
