VNC is commonly used by\nsystem administrators to remotely control a system for maintenance or to use shared resources.

VNC is less common than SSH or RDP but may be required by some work-flows such as remote access and\n    support for specialized software products or servers. Such work-flows are usually known and not unexpected.
