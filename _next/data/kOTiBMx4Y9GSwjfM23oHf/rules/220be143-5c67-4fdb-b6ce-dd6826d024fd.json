This feature allows Windows Error Reporting (WER)\nto collect data after an application crashes. This setting is a requirement for the LSASS Shtinkering attack, which\nfakes the communication of a crash on LSASS, generating a dump of the process memory, which gives the attacker access to\nthe credentials present on the system without having to bring malware to the system. This setting is not enabled by\ndefault, and applications must create their registry subkeys to hold settings that enable them to collect dumps.\n","from":"now-9m","index":["winlogbeat-*","logs-endpoint.events.registry-*","logs-windows.sysmon_operational-*","endgame-*","logs-m365_defender.event-*"],"language":"eql","license":"Elastic License v2","name":"Full User-Mode Dumps Enabled System-Wide","references":["https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wer/collecting-user-mode-dumps","https://github.com/deepinstinct/Lsass-Shtinkering","https://media.defcon.org/DEF%20CON%2030/DEF%20CON%2030%20presentations/Asaf%20Gilboa%20-%20LSASS%20Shtinkering%20Abusing%20Windows%20Error%20Reporting%20to%20Dump%20LSASS.pdf"],"risk_score":47,"rule_id":"220be143-5c67-4fdb-b6ce-dd6826d024fd","severity":"medium","tags":["Domain: Endpoint","OS: Windows","Use Case: Threat Detection","Tactic: Credential Access","Data Source: Elastic Defend","Data Source: Elastic Endgame","Data Source: Sysmon","Data Source: Microsoft Defender for Endpoint","Language: eql"],"timestamp_override":"event.ingested","type":"eql","query":"registry where host.os.type == \"windows\" and\n    registry.path : (\n        \"HKLM\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\Windows Error Reporting\\\\LocalDumps\\\\DumpType\",\n        \"\\\\REGISTRY\\\\MACHINE\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\Windows Error Reporting\\\\LocalDumps\\\\DumpType\"\n    ) and\n    registry.data.strings : (\"2\", \"0x00000002\") and\n    not (process.executable : \"?:\\\\Windows\\\\system32\\\\svchost.exe\" and user.id : (\"S-1-5-18\", \"S-1-5-19\", \"S-1-5-20\"))\n","threat":[{"framework":"MITRE ATT&CK","technique":[{"id":"T1003","name":"OS Credential Dumping","reference":"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003/","subtechnique":[{"id":"T1003.001","name":"LSASS Memory","reference":"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003/001/"}]}],"tactic":{"id":"TA0006","name":"Credential Access","reference":"https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0006/"}},{"framework":"MITRE ATT&CK","technique":[{"id":"T1112","name":"Modify Registry","reference":"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1112/"}],"tactic":{"id":"TA0005","name":"Defense Evasion","reference":"https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0005/"}}]}}},"__N_SSG":true}
