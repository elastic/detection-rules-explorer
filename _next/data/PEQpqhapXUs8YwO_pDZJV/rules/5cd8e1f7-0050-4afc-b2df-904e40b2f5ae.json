This allows them to keep operating after the security team discovers abused accounts.\n\nThis rule monitors events related to a user being added to a privileged group.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Identify the user account that performed the action and whether it should manage members of this group.\n- Contact the account owner and confirm whether they are aware of this activity.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- This attack abuses a legitimate Active Directory mechanism, so it is important to determine whether the activity is legitimate, if the administrator is authorized to perform this operation, and if there is a need to grant the account this level of privilege.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- If the admin is not aware of the operation, activate your Active Directory incident response plan.\n- If the user does not need the administrator privileges, remove the account from the privileged group.\n- Review the privileges of the administrator account that performed the action.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).\n\n## Setup\n\nIf enabling an EQL rule on a non-elastic-agent index (such as beats) for versions <8.2, events will not define `event.ingested` and default fallback for EQL rules was not added until 8.2, so you will need to add a custom pipeline to populate `event.ingested` to @timestamp for this rule to work.\n","references":["https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/plan/security-best-practices/appendix-b--privileged-accounts-and-groups-in-active-directory"],"risk_score":47,"rule_id":"5cd8e1f7-0050-4afc-b2df-904e40b2f5ae","severity":"medium","tags":["Domain: Endpoint","OS: Windows","Use Case: Threat Detection","Tactic: Persistence","Resources: Investigation Guide","Use Case: Active Directory Monitoring","Data Source: Active Directory"],"timestamp_override":"event.ingested","type":"eql","query":"iam where winlog.api:\"wineventlog\" and event.action == \"added-member-to-group\" and\n  group.name : (\"Admin*\",\n                \"Local Administrators\",\n                \"Domain Admins\",\n                \"Enterprise Admins\",\n                \"Backup Admins\",\n                \"Schema Admins\",\n                \"DnsAdmins\",\n                \"Exchange Organization Administrators\")\n","threat":[{"framework":"MITRE ATT&CK","technique":[{"id":"T1098","name":"Account Manipulation","reference":"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1098/"}],"tactic":{"id":"TA0003","name":"Persistence","reference":"https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0003/"}}]}}},"__N_SSG":true}
